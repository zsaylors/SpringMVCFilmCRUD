## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to have a web enabled app that can access a database related to films. The app needed to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) entries in the database.
The first page the app takes you to is the index.html which allows the user to search for films by Id or Keyword in the respective forms. There is also a link to a jsp that will add a film object to the database.
Once they look up a film, the user can Delete the film or update its data fields.



##Technologies
SpringToolSuite4: this was our IDE that we wrote the code in
MySQLWorkbench: this was alternative to terminal in order to access the database

##Lessons Learned
It helps to do a gradle refresh and project refresh to make sure all changes take effect.
