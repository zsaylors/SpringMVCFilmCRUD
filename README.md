### Overview
The purpose of this project is to have a web enabled app that can access a database related to films. So we decided to name it IMDb2. The app needed to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) entries in the database.
The first page the app takes you to is the index.html which allows the user to search for films by Id or Keyword in the respective forms. There is also a link to a jsp that will add a film object to the database.
Once they look up a film, the film info will display. The user can also Delete the film or update its data fields. The keyword search returns multiple results in a list so it displays all the results on the page.
To add a film the user has to click "add a video" button on the index or homepage. Then they fill out the form with the related fields for a film.



### Technologies
SpringToolSuite4: this was our IDE that we wrote the code in
MySQLWorkbench: this was alternative to terminal in order to access the database
Bootstrap- provides a nice template to make the html display nicely
CSS
HTML

### Lessons Learned
Auto generated IDs can be hidden sometimes.

It helps to do a gradle refresh and project refresh to make sure all changes take effect.
